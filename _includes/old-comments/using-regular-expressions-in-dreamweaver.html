          <p>GREAT! eventually I have found a comprehensive tutorial about regular
          expression. The internet is full of websites that are copies of each other,
          and they all have only one crap example with data validation. This is not
          only original but also a very informative page! Thanks!</p>

          <p>Seems like I&rsquo;ve been Googling for hours. I couldn&rsquo;t find out
          how you search for code that starts and ends with something specific, but can
          have any amount of code/text in-between.</p>

          <p>This regular expression stuff is hard for me to understand, but thanks to
          this page, I now know that (.*) will find a string of any length.</p>

          <p>For example, I added breadcrumb navigation near the end of the h1 tag to
          see if it would help my visitors. They didn&rsquo;t seem to use it and Google
          lowered the PageRank of all of my pages about a month later.</p>

          <p>I wanted to get rid of the breadcrumb navigation, but I didn&rsquo;t want
          to edit over 100 pages by hand again. I used what I learned from your page
          here and searched using this:</p>

          <p>(.*)</p>

          <p>And replaced it with this:</p>

          <p>The breadcrumb navigation on over 100 pages was gone in seconds.</p>

          <p>It&rsquo;s nice to know that I can use (.*) any time I need to search for
          a string of any size between a couple of pieces of specific code. What a
          great time saver and tedium eraser.</p>
